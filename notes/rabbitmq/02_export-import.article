RabbitMQ: Export and import

* Intro

There is no defined tool to do such operation so I had to search online.

* How?

* What didn't work: Unsuccessful tries

** amqp-tool

First I found this tool here:

.link amqp-tool https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqp-tool

Source at: https://github.com/FGRibreau/node-amqp-tool

I don't have node installed on my mac, so I create a docker container to test it.
Here is the dockerfile if you need:

    FROM ubuntu:latest
    RUN apt-get update && \
      apt-get install -y nodejs npm && \
      ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node && \
      npm install amqp-tool -g
    RUN /bin/bash

Build it:

    docker build -t <you>/amqp-tool .
    # [...] And run it
    docker run -it <you>/amqp-tool

But it just doesnâ€™t work. It hangs or fail.
