Raft (OBSOLETE)

** Performance

From [[https://github.com/hashicorp/raft][hashicorp/raft (github)]]:

    In terms of performance, Raft is comparable to Paxos. Assuming stable
    leadership, committing a log entry requires a single round trip to half of
    the cluster. Thus performance is bound by disk I/O and network latency.
