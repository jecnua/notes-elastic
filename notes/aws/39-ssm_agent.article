AWS SSM agent
|| Last update: 25 Feb 2021

* Intro

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html]]

go executable that polls API for commands.
The SSM agent SSM can be used to access nodes instead of SSH,as well as execute various tasks.

* Access a node

After you get the instance id:

    aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=private-ip-address,Values=x.x.x.x"

Access the node via AWS SSM:

    $ aws ssm start-session --target <InstanceId>
    # Or the following to directly get bash
    $ aws ssm start-session --target <InstanceId> --document-name AWS-StartInteractiveCommand --parameters \
    command="bash -l"

In a different region like CHINA:

    export AWS_REGION=cn-northwest-1
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=cn-northwest-1

* Run command

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up-messageAPIs.html]]
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-remote-commands.html]]

You can run a command to multiple nodes.

* Terraform

This is the role you need to use SSM on a node:

    data "aws_partition" "current" {}

    resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ssm_policy_att" {
      role       = aws_iam_role.my_role.name
      policy_arn = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM"
    }

* Monitoring

There is no immediate way to monitor when a node SSM agent lose contact with their control plane and become unavailable
(SSM agent PingStatus). There is no metrics on cloudwatch for it.
So it has be scripted by calling ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation API, parse the responses and then publish the metric to
CloudWatch.
