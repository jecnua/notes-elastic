* TAGS

Enforce tags with Tag Policies

    With Tag Policies, you have a simple way to ensure your developers apply
    consistent tags, audit tagged resources, and maintain proper resource
    categorization. Using Tag Policies, you can define tag keys, including how
    they should be capitalized, and their allowed values.
