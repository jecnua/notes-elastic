AWS Inspector
|| Last update: 13 Jul 2019

* Intro

It is REGION wide. You will need to replicate the code in each region.

** Installation

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_agents-on-linux.html]]

You can install is also via SSM if you want to do it via AWS.

** Install via ansible

In your requirements.yml:

    - src: git+https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-aws-inspector.git
      version: 15387c24bba9728f4044b3850f05ef7434fa9904
      name: aws-inspector

Then in the role:

* Permission

Inspector doesn't need any specific right for the vulnerability scan.
You just need to be able to download and install the agent.

* Notifications

You can send a notification to an SNS topic.
You can invoke a lambda from SNS if needed.
An example of the lambda is here ([[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/scale-your-security-vulnerability-testing-with-amazon-inspector/]], beware is 2016)
An example of auto-update in case of vulnerability is here [[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-remediate-amazon-inspector-security-findings-automatically/]]

When you create the SNS topic you need to add the right to inspector to write
on it.

    resource "aws_sns_topic" "sns_topic_aws_inspector" {
      name         = "eu-west-1-aws-inspector"
      display_name = "eu-west-1-aws-inspector"
    }

    resource "aws_sns_topic_policy" "sns_topic_aws_inspector_policy" {
      arn = "${aws_sns_topic.sns_topic_aws_inspector.arn}"

      policy = <<EOF
    {
     "Version": "2008-10-17",
     "Id": "inspector-sns-publish-policy",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "inspector-sns-publish-statement",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "inspector.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "SNS:Publish",
         "Resource": "${aws_sns_topic.sns_topic_aws_inspector.arn}"
       }
     ]
    }
    EOF
    }

Then you will have to register your email manually.

Example of CF template SNS policy:

Good example:

** Terraform limitations

At the moment there is not way to connect the new created inspect template to
an SNS topic. A request is open but it's stale.

The only thing I found https://github.com/kyhau/aws-cf-templates/blob/master/templates/Inspector-SNS.template

Example in CF:

- [[https://github.com/awslabs/server-fleet-management-at-scale/blob/master/deployment/server-fleet-management-at-scale-inspector.yaml]]

* Triggers

* Security

** CVE

- [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_cves.html]]
- [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_findings.html]]

    Amazon Inspector performs security assessments of Amazon EC2 instances by
    using AWS managed rules packages such as the Common Vulnerabilities and
    Exposures (CVEs) package.

** Network exposure

* Monitoring

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/using-cloudwatch.html]]

Not much on that side.
