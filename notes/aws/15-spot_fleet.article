- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#spot-fleet-health-checks]]

The health of a spot fleet node is checked every two minutes and is based
on the aws system healthcheck (no LB). It's up to the user to check the status
of it's node via [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html][api call]]
and act accordingly.

    aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

The node will need the iam: ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus

The node will be notified two minutes before removal.
