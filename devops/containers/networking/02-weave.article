FastDP after kernel 4.4.

Hello all, we have been testing Weave networking against our caching layers with fastdp+encryption and have been seeing a great deal of difference between the "physical" interface and the weave interface on EC2 instances using both the enhanced networking and non-enhanced networking instances.  I'm curious if Weave has been tested with low latency application services such as Memcached and Redis and what your results have looked like.

Using mutilate to replicate our production memcache traffic we see an average increase of ~50Î¼s over the Weave interface.
