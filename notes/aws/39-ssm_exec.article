SSM Exec
|| Last update: 7 Feb 2020

This is the role you need to use SSM on a node:

    data "aws_partition" "current" {}

    resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ssm_policy_att" {
      role       = aws_iam_role.my_role.name
      policy_arn = "arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM"
    }
