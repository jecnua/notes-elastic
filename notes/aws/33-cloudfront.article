    You cannot add an alternate domain name to a CloudFront distribution if the
    alternate domain name already exists in another CloudFront distribution,
    even if your AWS account owns the other distribution.
    However, you can add a wildcard alternate domain name, such as *.example.com,
    that includes (that overlaps with) a non-wildcard alternate domain name, such
    as www.example.com. Overlapping domain names can be in the same distribution
    or in separate distributions as long as both distributions were created by
    using the same AWS account. (emphasis added)
