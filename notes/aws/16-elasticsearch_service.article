* Ultraworm nodes

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/ultrawarm.html]]

AWS created a new set of nodes, called ultrawarm, that are basically s3 backed.
When you migrate data to that set of nodes you can afford to have only one shard.
The nodes will manage the calls to s3 and caching.

    aws_elasticsearch_domain.es: InvalidTypeException: You canâ€™t attach an
    IP-based policy to a domain that has a VPC endpoint. Instead, use a
    security group to control IP-based access.

If you use a SG don't use this policy.

    automated snapshots and retains up to 336 of them for 14 days.
    For domains running Elasticsearch 5.1 and earlier, Amazon ES takes daily
    automated snapshots (during the hour you specify) and retains up to 14 of
    them for 30 days.
