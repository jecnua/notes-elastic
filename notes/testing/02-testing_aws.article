* terraform

Without Sentinel, what type of audit terraform knows?

The only one it knows is terraform config.
it sees all changes as drift
you can only express what you want, no negatives (no ssh port open to the world)

* Intro

Testing can be divided in different phases.

* Phase 1: Static inspection

- Static testing of the CF: Look at the CF to reusing templates, nested stacks
- Are we statically put AMI in it or we use lambda to check if they exist
- NO embed any credential in CF
- Static test (using AG? you can statically test by looking at them and the workflow)

** Phase 2: Static testing of the file

- file validation
- cirlural arguments

** Phase 3: Integration test

Run something like inspec. Test with rules and permissions.

- DBs and instances are running
- things are where they should be
- sg are correct

*** awsspec

- [[https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec][awspec github]]

Work only for AWS.

*** test kitchen and inspec

Test kitchen as a plugin to use terraform.
Unfortunately test kitchen does not support multiple provisioners.
So you can't use terraform AND puppet.

*** Null resource

Is a resource terraform run AFTER everything else.
Can be used to trigger provisioners (or run inspect after).

** Phase 4: Feature tests

- it can autoscale up and down
- logging CW or CloudTrail
- check for the logs if there is anything in there

** Phase 5: Integration tests

- Trusted advisor

there is also something like reflective tests
or integration tests
test switch

* Inspec

- [[https://www.inspec.io/]]
- [[https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/platforms/]]
- [[https://github.com/inspec/inspec]]

Install inspect with:

    gem install inspec

You can open the inspec shell:

    inspec shell -t aws://<region>

The install iggy:

it's a plugin for inspect and you have inspect terraform and look at the state file
and extract out what is there to test.
only has knoweledge of what terraform knows plus some negative tests
and you will have a good coverage.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AJ8MS4BaQ0][Generating InSpec coverage from Terraform with InSpec-Iggy]]

    inspec plugin install inspec-iggy

Create a test dir (will be empty):

    inspec terraform generate

Generate real test

  insp  ec terraform generate --name test --tfstate terraform.tfstate

how to do a specific test?

  describe aws_security_group('sg-xxx') do
    it { should allow_in ipv4_range: '1.0.0.0/32' }
  end

ruby code

  control 'ssss' do
    aws_security_groups.group_ids.each do |group_id| # global search
      describe aws_security_group(group_id) do
        it { should_not allow_in(port: 22, ipv4_range: '0.0.0.0/0') }
      end
    end
  end

control block is only for nice formatting

if you want to call that from outside, use _exec_:

  inspec exec -t aws:// name_of_file.rb

* Best practice

aws cloudformation validation templates
you can create lambda function that represent you test case
look at the solution and take a look at the lambdas

git secrets from aws labs

aws saml cli on github

aws config and inspector

secret manager or paramete store

what are the limitations of it?

test kitchen checker and validators
they are moving to SAML
the lamdas each lambda call has a test

more reflection tests
->

==

sam cli

->

queue and control messages
