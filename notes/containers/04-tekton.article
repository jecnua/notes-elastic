Tekton - NEEDS CLEANING
|| Last update: 14 Sep 2020

* Intro

- [[tekton.dev]]

Used to build cicd system. Runs pipelines/command in container.

Add CRD in your k8s and use this pieces as building box.

- Steps
- Tasks - a sequence of step that run ion sequential steps (reusable) - run as a pod
- Pipeline - sequences a set of tasks - ordered list
- PipelineRun - An instance of a pipeline execution. they can be created dynamically

Steps are run inside the same step in the same container.
Pipeline are a collections of tasks.

It has input and outputs.

- TaskRuns is a specific execution of a task
- PipelineRuns is the specific execution of a Pipeline

Pipeline resources??

- [[https://github.com/joellord/handson-tekton]]

tekton is a cloud-native microservices factory.
you can have fewer pipeline than repository if a lot of microservices are the
same.

* Interesting

You can ask for inputs and validate them.

In a step if you write in the home folder you can read in the next step the same
file.

a pipeline can be used to pass parameters to a set of tasks.

you can use a PV as a workspace for a pipeline
and you can have workspace output for example

share difference resources between task is still in alpha mode ???

you need to specify the workspace in every tasks
to communicate between themselves

workspaces are not fully working yet
they are still in alpha
sharing different resources in tasks

the rest is in beta

* PV

Sometimes PV are created implicitly even if you don't define it.
you can see it by seeing the yaml definition of the pod created

if there are multiple tasks in the pipeline
it will do it automatically

so you need to HAVE dynamic provisioning

** Workspaces

they need a Volume Claim template

* Credential

- build input
- Service account -  needs to say which secrets needs to be picked up

you need to create secrets with annotation
to tell tekton to use them

credential initializer container
tkn logs
you can't have multiple Credential
for a single external resources

if you need multiple credential
you need to patch to different service account

ONLY ONE SECRET PER TARGET RESOURCE (tasks run on behalf of users, not as those
users)

* Tekton hub

is in preview where you can find other people task and pipelines

* Others

VS extension
Tekton triggers? - just use any webhook and create a pipeline run for you
Trugger subproject
PipelineRun logs lifetime tied to PipelineRun instances
