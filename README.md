# Notes, slides and random thoughts

If you wish to see them and run them locally on your machine (I don't see why,
unless you are me...), install
[go present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present).

If you don't want to (for example, you are not me :D) use the [online render](http://go-talks.appspot.com).

To use it take the service url:

    http://go-talks.appspot.com

and add the path of what you want to read. Something like:

https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/jecnua/notes-presentations/projects/weave/weave_cloud.article

The service refreshed every hour.
