Zipkin is a distribuited tracing system written in Java.
It's responsible for SPAN ingestion and storage.

Zipkin was created by Twitter in 2012 based on the Google Dapper paper. In 2015,
OpenZipkin became the primary fork.

OpenZipkin is an org on GitHub. It contains tracers, OpenApi spec,
service components and docker images.

** Components

- Tracers collectors report spans to HTTP, kafka, scribe, etc
- Storage engines collect spans storing them in Mysql, Cassandra, etc
- Users query for traces via Zipkinâ€™s Web UI or Api.
