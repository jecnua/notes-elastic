AWS perimeter security - WAF, Shield and Firewall Manager
|| Last update: 9 Apr 2019

* Intro

- WAF
- Shield (paid have for free WAF and firewall)
- Firewall Manager (centralise multiple account management and rules application)

* WAF

WAF is a web application firewall (application level protection) able to work on:

- API gateway
- Cloudfront
- ALB

It is able to respond with either requested content or 403 (forbidden) status
code (it can be configured).

There are three main behaviours:

- Allow all except specified
- Deny all except specified
- Count requests that match the specified rules (to test rules before applying them)

You can use WAF separately from Shield and other tools.

You use WAF by creating *conditions*, *rules* and *web*access*control*list* (web
ACLs).
You define conditions, combine conditions into rules and combine rules into ACL.

    Use global to create WAF resources that you would associate with CloudFront
    distributions and other regions for WAF resources that you would associate
    with ALBs and API Gateway stages in that region.
    Source: AWS interface

It can protect you from:

- Bad bots
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- DDoS - SYN/UDP/ICMP/[[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/http-flood-ddos-attack/][HTTP flood]]

** Conditions

The *conditions* define basic characteristic what you are looking for in the
web requests. You can use to create rules can be based on multiple elements:

- IP address or range (max 10k IPs or IP ranges) - Supports /8 or any range from /16 to /32 CIDR blocks for IPv4
- Country
- Request headers
- Specific string in requests that matches a regex
- Length
- SQL code (protect against SQL code injection)
- Script (protect against cross-site scripting)

Some conditions take multiple values.

** Rules

Rules are a combination of one or more conditions. There are two types of rules:

- Regular
- Rate based

When more than one condition is set, WAF will block only the one that will fit
*ALL* conditions (it's a logic AND).

*** Regular rules

You need at least one condition for regular rule (it's optional but makes no
sense to have an empty one).

*** Rate based rules

- [[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/protect-web-sites-services-using-rate-based-rules-for-aws-waf/]]
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-get-started-rate-based-rules.html]]

Rules can be applied with a *rate*limit*. This type of rules triggers an action
only if the set of _conditions_ exceeds the limit per data point (5 minutes).
Protect against DDoS attack.

    Rules that can allow, block, or count web requests that meet the specified
    conditions. Alternatively, rules can block or count web requests that not
    only meet the specified conditions, but also exceed a specified number of
    requests in any 5-minute period.
    Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html

Number of conditions are optional (0 or more). If not condition is set it will
apply to all requests and it will just rate limit per IPs (default).

The matched rules need to match some criteria and the rate is counted in 5
minutes intervals. By using this you can stop an application layer attach based
on volume.

- High volume low entropy
- High volume high entropy

Rate based rules only works with _high_volume_of_traffic_.

The lower for rate limit is *2000* (CHECK).

With rate it will block the connections until the 5 minutes passes and that rate
is no more firing.
If more than one condition is set in the rule, ALL (logical AND) needs to apply.

*IMPORTANT*: Rules that do not meet ALL conditions will not be counted towards
the rate limit and would not be blocked by the rule.

*** Web ACL

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html]]

You combine rules into ACLs. You can use ACL in WAF. You can have multiple ACL
and each ACL have multiple rules. There are three types of actions:

- Allow
- Block
- Count

There is a default action for each rule.

WAF compares a web request with the rules in an ACL in the order they are
defined. It will take the action of the *first* rule that the request matches.

Using count help here too. A rule that counts requests is affected by it's
position in the web ACL.

A default action is specified in case no rules in an ACL match and it can be
block or allow.

    On some occasions, AWS WAF might encounter an internal error that delays the
    response to API Gateway, CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer about
    whether to allow or block a request. On those occasions, API Gateway and
    CloudFront will typically will allow the request or serve the content. An
    Application Load Balancer typically will deny the request and not serve the
    content.

** Logs and ElasticSearch

      COGNITO
      amazon cognito authentication for kibana
      user pool
      and you can create users
      you can create a federated identity
      and that is what allows an application and will pass an user authentication
      through cognito

      create a stream for each account
      you can send them to firehose
      firehose delivery stream
      IAM role for kinesis to deliver the logs and copy from s3
      you can get only failures or all messages
      buffer???

      WAF logs are accessible even for the non paid version
      and when you pay they can do it for you. ooooh so difficult -.-

** Monitoring

Itâ€™s nice to monitor # of blocked vs. allowed requests over time, per individual rule and totals.

** Rules and Dynamic adaptation

- [[https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-waf-security-automations/]]

A pattern AWS pushes for is having CloudFront writing access files in a bucket
and having a lambda trigger every time a new file is created. This lambda
can find IPs that are causing a lot of errors or trying to access specific
endpoint with malicious intent.

The lambda can create or update an existing rule to add this IPs to a block
ACL (temporary or permanently).

** Existing patterns

* Shield

2016. DDoS protection

2 tiers:

- standard (default): available to all (automatic)
- advanced: higher level visibility and protection. COver also EC2, CloudFront, ELB and route53.

* Shield advanced

Adds additional feature on top of WAF like a dedicated support from the DDoS
Response team (DRT) and advanced reporting.

advanced give a 'point and protect' wizard.
based on normal traffic
looking at your traffic (baseline)
24/7 DDoS response team (DRT)
cloudwatch metrics
tech xxx
global threat environment dashboard (is just a fancy dashboard to all the attach and reaction they took in the x amount of time on AWS)
attack diagnostic
protect from economic attach

you get WAF at no additional cost
AWS firewall manager at no cost
cost protection from scaling

** DDoS response team (DRT)

mitigation runbook for supporting AWS properties
automation which reduce time to respond
switft mitigation in attach

is not a team of people, is a service that engages for DDoS
when anomalies are notified
internal customers are the AWS services
automation around

receiving signals from Shield services

there are internal services
called lookout
net flow telemetry and from log
it works with this internal services
to recognise that

another is called *blackwatches"
packet filters array
edge boxes have this
transit centres have them
and they enga**

they enough packets so that the client
can maintain service
go give you overhead

they want drop all the packages only some of them
to allow you to scale and not me DDoS

full automated workflow
you can get this metrics only from shield advanced

** Type of engagement (PAID)

pre-emptive

- DDoS architecture review
- custom mitigation templates

blakwatch is a tool to day 'hey, protect this'
when shield detect the attack
and the template calibrates to the target
like the size of the machine about how much you can manage

if you need to use static ip
you can't use cname
so you can't use cloudfront
you can create a custom mitigation template for that cases
and this one take PRECEDENCE over the default one
plus you can decide things knowing the application of the client
speking with them

- operational readiness inquiry (priori to IEM infrastructure event manager)

24x7 incident response

- atumatically engaged for availabllity impacting the l3/l4 events again your resource
- ???
- ???

shield engagement lambda function
it will create a support ticket
for you

it will actually page the DDoS person in support in AWS
15m for SLA?
otherwise 1h?
for DDoS things escalate to DRT
and bypass 15m of the ticket by using the lambda

they are on call with
5m SLA and 24/7

the DRT operator will join the call and speak with you
to mitigate

the lambda
AWS-shield-lambda
shieldengagementLambda.js
if you are not enterprise don't put URGENT

CHECK
they will be paged
2 pizza team
will page one of them?
is crazy?
CHECK

13 engagement out of the total
6 were erroneous
rest for the most part where legacy stuff

when you page them:

- do you have the right people in the call
- are you prepared to make change? - if the fix is an architectural change can you do this?

runbook two colums
the problem
the solution
and who is responsible for that?
like if you need to change the route53 and so on. who can do it

- what is my application health - smoke test, distributed performance test,

how do we know if we are clear?

ADVANCED COUNTERMEASURES

BGP traffic engineering
communicates what routes are available and you can
send announcement. leaking a route and shift it to another. like move the traffic
directed in japane to america and move part of the traffic

custom BlackWatch mitigations (depending on the application)
- pattern matching
- geo-shaping
- NACLs
look for pattern in the traffic and set different threshold.

AWS WAF rules
- log parsing
like to find botnet ips

architecture GAPs analysis
- is more personal and manual

example of pattern matching
like for games and udp
they would up a pattern in in the package
and is less dangerous to make it on the wire (???)
they can put some iptable roles
and move it from the ??? to ???
WAF can bake the rule in the WAF
"if they have this pattern drop it"
CHECK FOR MORE

** STEPS to use shield advanced

some steps are the same some only with advanced:

1) shield is a registraction service. it associates arns with workflow
but if you don't tell which arns wthey won't do
they monitor netowrking and application layes
you can register

- ALL LB
- cloudfront
- route53
- EIP

2) use cloudfront and route53 over an LB. IPV6 is not supported.

it maintains 2 network. the zones and external traffic 9route53 and cloudfront
160 hop
*black watches* is online there
https/https
ere is deterministic

in the region everything goes so is more difficult

3) use WAF and rate-based rules to mitigate application attach

you can use WAF at any level
but if possible push it out
like it to the cloudfront
and not the LB
is better because it's easier to recognise it
having WAF on cloudfront can help stop before it reaches origin

4) monitor the cloudwatch alert for WAF (ONLY SHIELD ADVANCED)

attack detected (0 or 1) - simple to activate stuff
curve vector ???

TIP
if you use route53 healthcheck
you can correlate with WAF rules

5) engage with the DRT

if you have resource outside of AWS you can still cover them with CF
cloudfront is a sort of proxy
origin can be a website

you can associate CF with an ACL

** PAID (SHIELD ADVANCE)

there is a button that says ENGAGE with DRT (ONLY PAID)
gives read-write access to the WAF
choose an existing role for the drt

there is a s3 bucket???
you can give them the s3 bucket of the logs
so basically they want to give logs to DRT
you can pre-chooose an s3 bucket
with all your logs
and give it to them

sometimes people use the DRT like an ambulance so if they can react fast
they can read the logs
find an ip and add it to the WAF

it can scan for all the resources (GUI)
and it shows them to you
click them to say protect resources

then it tells if you want to add acl to xyz

then it asks if you want to create a cloudwatch alarm
and you can write to an sns topic
you can use lambda to notify everywhere

current incident bump up to the top
on the gui

there is a whitepaper
AWS architecture for DDoS <--- search for it

balckwatch looks at the header
and drops the most suspiction package first
for games for example
like UDP
header are not useful, so they need to look better
and they need to drop only the ones that have a pattern?

customized security
custom rules (based on your traffic)
you can use pre-configured rules (on the marketplace, 3rd party)
monitoring (cloudwatch)
ability to pass log though 3rd party

create security automation
with lambda to react

WAF works with alb, cloudfront and api gateway

sql injection
xss  consition
marketplace rules

web traffic filtering

- rate based rules
ip match and geo filter
regex and string match condition
size constraint (?? condition)

visibility and debugging

sampled blogs
comprehensive logging (all of them???)

managed rules from the marketplace
you can pay and use them
pay as you go
pay and apply and you can apply to your web acl
you can pay and try and you can stop paying every time
vendors can cover different things

security automation?
you can run a CF template and can ???
take logs, run through lambda do analysis and change rules on the fly

there are a lot of options:

- bot protection
- etc

you can take the code and automate it

** guard duty

you can use a lamba to connect the WAF with guard duty
and if you find one ip attacking you
you can add it to the rule

* Firewall manager

simplify the management of rules in all the account of your accounts
and applications
even if you have one account and multiple resources

AWS organization can create global firewall rules
but then single account can manipolate other(???) the same(???)
automatically discover new resources
if you add new account
this allow compliance everywhere

rapid response to internet attacks
single console
they are basically WAF rules
quickly apply CVE patches and so on

* Q/A

** difference

you won't get the alarm, history or metics
no economic protection
no WAF rules that goes with it

different in protection between standard and paid
is the rules and metrics

for example no bgp and so on

the automatic stuff is not there

for some particular attack
that is when you get the benefits of the paid one

london, frankfurt
to protect DDoS
put on us-east-1
go where the attacks are
you want more overhead

** why minimum is 2000?

you can't change the number of minutes 5
and the minimum is 2000

** how to get lower than 2000

use the same match condition
like /
then you can put than  everywhere
you can get all the way down to 20
???
CHECK

** rate page rules intelligence

now the focus just to reduce the number
no intelligence

** different rules and different pattern????

you can use a string match
limited regex support
you can put one rule to embrace multiple behaviour

can you package the rules in the same RBR

firewall manager????? you can do?????

there is a soft limit of 10 rules
you can have in a web ACL
there will be improvement with that too

** in the WAF logs there is a code why something was blocked

it does not give you any context
the WAF is not retorni anything
is just a 403 forbidden from CF

there is no error code
is not build it

you need lambda at edge

they don't want to disclose to the client why you are??? rejecting???

WAF is not a proxy
is not an ???
WAF is a compute cell than lives on xxx
like elb or cloudfront
and respond to ??? with an ???
cloudfront and elb don't know why they just see the error

why? it needs to be fast
and? xxx

** some bot cycle

only some portion of the botnet attack you and cycle every couple of minutes or
so.

** There is IP reputation list

WAF by default has a few
but you can pull down grep list and add them
there is a lambda function for it.

you can use them for

- whitelist
- replication list ???
- blacklist

you can make a baseline with 6 rules of less

** shadow rules in waf

drt can subscripe waf customer to amazon.co.uk list
that they don't even know anything about
hashed
but they can use the list in waf
and they can give it to user

you can have cloudfront
with no cachine
forward all
but do ssl termination
to get application accelleration

<somthing> sky defender
their waf
they have actively alerting towards lmt
-> they mitigate it
-> and they tell you what they did

is it possible to lift and shift stuff
you can't do the real stuff, just their name
they iterate over them
and got some of them turned off

ddos
over aggressively bots
