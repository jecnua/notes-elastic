* VPN solution to link cloud account

Openswan/Strongswan to build the VPN solution.

Both OpenSwan and StrongSwan are forks for continued development after FreeS/WAN project closed up shop.


Red Hat 6 has moved away from IPSec-Tools and uses OpenSwan now.
Looks like Ubuntu is moving from IPsec-Tools to StrongSwan in 14.04

which one?
